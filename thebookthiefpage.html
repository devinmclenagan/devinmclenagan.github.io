    <p>By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=AXXRKej4tA&rank=1">See more</a></p>
